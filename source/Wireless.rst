The IC of the Wireless Module is the TI CC1100, which
is a low-cost, 433 MHz radio
designed for very low-power wireless applications

Many MCR applications require a wireless
communication channel for transmitting information
from inside the human body. This communication must
often be performed with relatively high data rates
for real-time applications with transmission power
bound to medically safe limits. Sub 1 GHz carriers
with lower energy absorption rates in human
tissues are the most suitable for medical devices.
