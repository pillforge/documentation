The A3901 is a dual full-bridge motor driver,
designed for low voltage portable applications
involving bipolar stepper or brush dc motors.
The outputs have been optimized for low voltage drop,
with currents up to ±400 mA (±800 mA with outputs paralleled)
and an operating voltage range of 2.5 to 5.5 V.

**Key Features**

-	Low RDS(on) outputs
-	Full- and half-stepping capability
-	Small package
-	Forward, reverse, and brake modes for dc motors
-	Sleep mode with zero current drain
-	PWM control up to 250 kHz
-	Crossover-current protection
-	Thermal shutdown (TSD)
